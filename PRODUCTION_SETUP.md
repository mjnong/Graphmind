# Production-Ready File Upload System Setup

## Current Status ✅

### ✅ **Database Layer**
- SQLAlchemy Upload model with proper fields
- Pydantic schemas for validation
- CRUD operations for file management
- Service layer with proper error handling
- Alembic migration support

### ✅ **Storage Layer**
- Local storage implementation
- S3 storage support (placeholder)
- Configurable storage backend

### ✅ **API Layer**
- File upload endpoints (single & multiple)
- Progress tracking via WebSocket
- Status checking endpoints
- Proper error handling

### ✅ **Worker Layer**
- Celery worker with detailed progress reporting
- Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
- File processing pipeline

### ✅ **Docker Infrastructure**
- PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Dragonfly (Redis-compatible) broker
- Neo4j graph database
- Proper networking and health checks

## Immediate Steps to Deploy 🚀

### 1. Generate Database Migration
```bash
cd /Users/mjnong/repos/custom-graphRAG
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add uploads table"
alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Start Services
```bash
cd Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Test Upload System
Open `upload_test.html` in your browser and test file uploads.

## What's Working Now 💪

1. **File Upload Flow:**
   - Upload file → Store in local storage → Create DB record → Queue processing task

2. **Real-time Progress:**
   - WebSocket connection for live updates
   - Progress notifications from worker to frontend
   - Status tracking (uploaded → processing → complete/failed)

3. **Processing Pipeline:**
   - Celery worker processes files asynchronously
   - Different handling for PDFs, images, text files
   - Detailed progress reporting with custom messages

- [x] Circuit breakers for automatic service protection
- [x] Comprehensive error handling API endpoints
- [x] Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Security Features Implemented ✅

### 🔐 **File Type Validation**
- **Magic number checking**: Validates files based on their binary signatures, not just extensions
- **Content-type verification**: Ensures uploaded content matches declared MIME type
- **Extension validation**: Restricts uploads to safe file extensions
- **Supported formats**: JPEG, PNG, PDF, TXT with proper validation

### 📏 **File Size Limits**
- **Per-file limits**: Configurable maximum file size (default: 100MB)
- **Total upload limits**: Prevents abuse with multiple large files
- **Real-time validation**: Size checking before processing starts
- **Graceful error handling**: Clear error messages for oversized files

### 🚦 **Rate Limiting**
- **Per-IP limiting**: Configurable requests per minute (default: 60/min)
- **Redis-backed**: Persistent rate limiting across application restarts
- **Sliding window**: More accurate than fixed time windows
- **Burst protection**: Configurable burst allowance for legitimate usage

### 📋 **Configuration Options**
```env
# Security settings in .env file
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=100
MAX_FILES_PER_UPLOAD=10
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=10
```

### 🛡️ **Validation Process**
1. **Rate limit check**: Before any processing
2. **File existence**: Ensure file is provided
3. **Extension validation**: Check against allowed extensions
4. **Size validation**: Verify within limits
5. **Magic number validation**: Binary signature verification
6. **Content inspection**: Additional safety checks
7. **Storage and processing**: Only after all validations pass

### 📊 **New API Endpoints**
- `GET /files/security/config`: View current security settings
- Enhanced upload responses with validation details
- Detailed error messages for validation failures

## Comprehensive Error Handling System ✅

### ⚡ **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- **Redis-backed state management**: Persistent circuit breaker states across worker restarts
- **Configurable thresholds**: Failure threshold, recovery timeout, success threshold
- **Automatic state transitions**: Closed → Open → Half-Open → Closed
- **Service protection**: Prevents cascading failures across service dependencies

### 🎚️ **Graceful Degradation**
- **Service level management**: Full → Degraded → Basic → Maintenance modes
- **Automatic fallback handlers**: Seamless fallback to simpler processing when services fail
- **Feature availability tracking**: Dynamic feature flags based on real-time service health
- **User experience preservation**: System remains functional even during partial outages

### 💀 **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
- **Failed task persistence**: Comprehensive storage of failed tasks with error details and context
- **Manual retry capabilities**: API endpoints for reviewing and retrying failed tasks
- **Bulk operations**: Retry multiple tasks simultaneously with status tracking
- **Automatic cleanup**: Configurable retention periods for failed task history

### 📊 **Error Handling API Endpoints**
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live service health and circuit breaker status
- **Failed task management**: View, retry, and delete failed tasks through REST API
- **Circuit breaker control**: Manual reset and detailed status monitoring
- **System analytics**: Comprehensive error statistics and failure pattern analysis

### 🔧 **Usage Examples**

#### Monitor System Health
```bash
# Get overall system health
curl http://localhost:8000/error-handling/health

# Check specific circuit breaker
curl http://localhost:8000/error-handling/circuit-breakers/neo4j
```

#### Manage Failed Tasks
```bash
# View failed tasks
curl http://localhost:8000/error-handling/failed-tasks

# Retry specific tasks
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/error-handling/retry-tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task_ids": ["task-1", "task-2"]}'
```

#### Service Level Awareness
```bash
# Check current service level
curl http://localhost:8000/error-handling/service-level

# Get available features
curl http://localhost:8000/error-handling/health | jq '.available_features'
```
