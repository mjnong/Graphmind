Simplified Neo4j Retrieval Query for GraphRAG - Medical & Scientific Applications

This query is designed for DEEP CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING with multi-hop exploration,
returning clean, structured data that's ready for LLM consumption without complex parsing.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This query works with nodes AND scores that have already been filtered by vector/fulltext search.
The 'node' and 'score' parameters come from the retriever's search results, not all nodes in the database.

üî• SCORE HANDLING: The query properly preserves and returns similarity scores from the HybridCypherRetriever,
enabling accurate similarity-based filtering for quality control.

üè• MEDICAL-GRADE FEATURES:
- ‚úÖ 3-hop relationship exploration for deep medical insights
- ‚úÖ Multi-layered entity connections (Direct ‚Üí Extended ‚Üí Deep)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive context building for complex medical knowledge
- ‚úÖ Robust property handling (only uses existing Neo4j GraphRAG properties)
- ‚úÖ Clean structured output ready for LLM processing

Key Medical Use Cases:
- ü©∫ Drug-Disease-Gene interactions across multiple papers
- üß¨ Protein-pathway-phenotype relationships in research literature
- üè• Clinical symptom-diagnosis-treatment knowledge networks
- üìä Research finding connections across studies and publications
- üî¨ Scientific concept relationships in complex domains

Advanced Features:
- üìÑ Clean document content without formatting overhead
- üîç Local context information when available  
- üîó Direct entity relationships (1-hop) as structured lists
- üåê Extended knowledge network (2-hop) for broader context
- üß† Deep knowledge insights (3-hop) for comprehensive understanding
- Structured output perfect for LLM understanding and post-processing
- üéØ Accurate similarity scores preserved from HybridCypherRetriever
- üöÄ Optimized for performance with minimal string concatenation
